Portfolio for Data Science

## [Project 1: Game programming and analysis](https://github.com/haden-liu/DSI_Project1)

In this project, I created and modified the elements and features with Python data structures and control flow in order to assist the online gaming development. Following technologies & algorithms have been applied.

  - Python data structures
  - Python syntax and control flow
  - basic descriptive statistics
  
 ## [Project 2: Civic data analyses](https://github.com/haden-liu/DSI_Project2)
 
 This project focuses on following two parts:
 
  - EDA & visualization to view historical insights of data
  - Hypothesis Test & Outlier Analysis

 Technologies: 
  
  - Python packages: Numpy, scipy.stats, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, csv
  - Statistics: hypothesis test, Outlier Analysis, Spearman Correlation

## [Project 3: Regression and classification with housing data](https://github.com/haden-liu/DSI_Project3)

This project focuses on to apply the linear regression models with regualarization (Lasso & Ridge), as well as the feature re-engineering techniques to predict the housing sales prices, and obtain the feature importance with coefficient calculation

## [Project 4: Web Scraping Job Postings](https://github.com/haden-liu/DSI_Project4)

In this project, I used BeautifulSoup package to scrap the data science job details from Indeed website. I also applied NLP techniques such as TF/IDF models to doing feature importance analysis on the factors impact on the job classification and salary

## [Capstone Project - Supervised Learning Based Prediction on Commerical Flight Delaying](https://github.com/haden-liu/DSI-Capstone-Project)

In my final project of DSI course, I choose the dataset contains flight records among US cities during Janaury 2020. I used various classification algorithms to get the feature importances on factors that have impact to predict whether a future flight will be delayed. I also attempted the NLP techniques to calculate the feature importances of features with object datatype and see their impacts on the delaying status.
